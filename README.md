# Syntalos Timing Validation

Sample scripts to analyze and validate timestamps created by Syntalos.

These scripts were used for the publication:

Klumpp et al. Syntalos: A software for precise simultaneous multi-modal data acquisition and closed-loop interventions, 11 January 2024,
PREPRINT (Version 1) available at Research Square [doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3793251/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3793251/v1)

**You will have to modify the Python code to suit your individual test setup!**

For more information on how to build a test setup to acquire the right data, and on how
to use the code in this repository, you can check the "[Verifying time delays](https://syntalos.org/docs/timesync-verification/)"
page in the Syntalos documentation.
